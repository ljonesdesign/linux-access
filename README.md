A few sample files to introduce Access Queries

The file systems on Mac, PC, and Linux operating systems are essentially database systems. In this short demo I will ```gitclone``` the files in this repository into my opal account and use the ``ls`` command with some wildcards. You will need to use wildcards in Access, so the purpose of this demo is to show how the same query concepts can work across multiple operation systems and applications.
